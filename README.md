# Optimizing-Game-Performance-through-AI-Driven-LOD-and-Neural-Network-Based-Image-Compression

This repository provides the source code and resources for implementing advanced artificial intelligence strategies to optimize game performance in graphics rendering. Specifically, it focuses on **AI-driven Level of Detail (LOD)** and **neural network-based image compression techniques**, offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing the performance of resource-intensive virtual worlds.

The **AI-driven Level of Detail (LOD)** method dynamically adjusts the complexity of character behaviors and animations based on their proximity to the camera and visibility. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead by simplifying animations, collision avoidance, and pathfinding for less prominent virtual entities, while maintaining high visual fidelity for on-screen characters.  

The **neural network-based image compression techniques** leverage state-of-the-art models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and attention-based architectures, to compress texture files while preserving high visual quality. These methods reduce texture sizes for efficient memory usage and faster loading times without compromising the playerâ€™s experience.

The methodologies were rigorously tested in a **virtual simulation of an Urban City environment**, featuring a variety of complex scenarios, including:
- **Character-intensive indoor scenes** with highly detailed agents and interactions.
- **Open-world settings** involving large-scale terrains and diverse background elements.

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across key performance metrics:
- **Frame rates** increased by up to 50%.
- **Memory consumption** reduced by up to 45%.
- **Loading times** decreased by up to 37.5%.

This repository aims to provide a reproducible framework for researchers and developers seeking to integrate AI-driven LOD and neural network-based image compression into their game projects. Detailed source code, pre-trained models, and testing scripts are included, along with clear instructions for replicating the experiments.

While this project highlights the efficacy of combining AI-driven optimizations, it also addresses challenges such as scaling these methods for larger, more complex virtual worlds. Future directions include refining these techniques and exploring their potential applications in next-generation game engines and immersive virtual environments.
